Welcome & Introduction





Welcome to FlexCAD 2021! As a newly developed program, FlexCAD is one of the simplest 3D modeling websites that allows you to create your own 3D model and make incredible designs in cooperation with your teammates. As a 3D modeling software, FlexCAD runs in your web-browser. FlexCAD was designed to target both beginner designers and professional designer teams.



Main Features of FlexCAD:
	The following lists a list of main features of FlexCAD 2021.

Login/register User account

Export project file 




In order to better understand the main features, the following sessions will be a walk through and illustrate the steps individually. At the end of the tutorial, you will be able to know the individual steps of creating a 3D model on FlexCAD and ultimately creating your own FlexCAD project.
Login & Register

Login      
(Figure 1)
In order for users to Login the FlexCAD, users are required to register their own account first. Above is a picture of the FlexCAD’s Login page, unregistered users should click the “Signup” sign in order to register their own account first.

Signup
 After we click in the Signup page, the figure 2 shows in below:
                               (Figure 2)
For this example, we are using “user” as username, “Email@gmail.com” for email and “1234” as password. After we click the submit button, we will be automatically redirected to the main page of FlexCAD. In addition, users are able to direct login to the FlexCAD with “Email@gmail.com” as the email address and “1234” as the password.
Main page 

(Figure 3)

Figure 3 was the main page of FlexCAD. On the right top corner it shows the user’s username. By clicking on the username, users are able to change the user profile for this account.
At the left top corner of the main page it listed 6 different buttons: “Application”, “Add”, “Project”, “InviteEditor”, “History”, “Export”:

Application: By clicking on application button, the users can load a new project or save current project
Add: Add button was for adding new geometries in the project
Project: Users can choose to open a different project or creating a new project
InviteEditor: An URL was automated generated and can invite other users to edit the ongoing project
History: A page of different edit steps listed with the change , changed time and editor’s username.
Export: Export the current project as JSON file to local computer


Create and l/S project; Invite editor; Export file

Create project

Normally after a user login to their account, FlexCAD will automatically open the latest project the user was working on. Due to the example user being a newly registered user, the FlexCAD automatically generated a new project for him. To create a new project, simply click on the Project button and click the “New project” will work. 
(Figure 4)

Load/Save project
By clicking the application button, the FlexCAD will pop up a window with”load” and “save”. Users can load other JSON files from the local computer to the server by clicking the load button. Users can also save the existing project to a JSON file on the FlexCAD server by clicking the save button.
(Figure 5)

Invite Other Editors
By clicking the InviteEditor button, a url will be automatically generated. Users can copy the url and share it with other users they wanted to share. The other users automatically gain the edit right for this project.

Export File
By clicking the export button, a JSON file for this project will be automatically generated and stored in the userfiles folder on this user’s computer.  For this case, Figure 6 shows the JSON file and Figure 7 shows the content in the JSON file. Because we haven’t edited the project, the user.json was empty.
(Figure 6)
(Figure 7)


Editing Project

Adding Geographic
After clicking on the add button, a list of geometries shows up in the window.
 (Figure 8)

Now the user will click on the cube,as shown below in Figure 9, a cube was created in the center of the project. We can move the cube around by dragging the cube through holding the left click button of the mouse. Now, the cube has been moved to another place in Figure 10 with the coordinates and color listed on the right. 
(Figure 9)
(Figure 10)


Change geometry color
Users can change each geometry’s color by clicking the color button listed on the right and choosing a different color. As shown in Figure 11, users can click the color below to change the cube’s color or directly type the color dex in the box. In this example, we will change the color of the cube by typing 4EDEDB in the box, the result shows in Figure 12.
(Figure 11)
(Figure 12)
Export edited project
The last step of this tutorial is to export the edited project. Now, click the Export button as what we have done in the “Export file” step on page 7. An updated version of the user.json shown up in the userfiles folder and below is the content of it:
(Figure 13)
From Figure 13, we are able to tell that the JSON file contains a list of types, coordinates and colors of the geometry in the project.







Conclusion

 That’s it! Thanks for choosing FlexCAD as your 3D modeling software. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial so far. If you have any additional questions, check the Q&A listed on the homepage or contact our consumer support team.
